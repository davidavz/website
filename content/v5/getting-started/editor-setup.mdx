Please refer to the [v3 documentation on the Tailwind CSS website](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) for more information.

## Editor Support for Custom ClassName Props

When using `cssInterop` or `remapProps` to create custom className props for third-party components, you may need to configure your editor to recognize these new props for proper IntelliSense and autocomplete.

For detailed information about working with third-party components and creating custom className props, see the [Styling Third-Party Components](../guides/third-party-components) guide.

### VS Code Configuration

If you're using VS Code with the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension, you can add custom className props to the `tailwindCSS.classAttributes` setting:

```json
{
  (...)
  "tailwindCSS.classAttributes": [
    "class",
    "className",
    "headerClassName"
  ]
}
```

This will enable autocomplete and IntelliSense for your custom className props created with `cssInterop` or `remapProps`.
