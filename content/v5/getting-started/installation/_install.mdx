import NPM from "./_npm.mdx";

You will need to install `nativewind` and its peer dependencies `tailwindcss`, `react-native-css`, `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-safe-area-context`.

<NPM
  framework={props.framework}
  deps={[
    "nativewind@5.0.0-preview.0",
    "react-native-css",
    "react-native-reanimated",
    "react-native-safe-area-context",
  ]}
/>
