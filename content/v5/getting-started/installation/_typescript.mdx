<Callout type="tip">
  You can bypass manually creating this file by running `npx expo start --clear` in your Expo project's root directory.

If you're using TypeScript in your project, you'll need to set up the type definitions. Nativewind extends the React Native types via declaration merging. The simplest method to include the types is to create a new `nativewind-env.d.ts` file and add a [triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) referencing the types.

```tsx
/// <reference types="react-native-css/types" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited and should be committed with your source code. It is generated by react-native-css. If you need to move or disable this file, please see the documentation.
```

<Callout type="warn" title="CAUTION">
Do not call this file:

- `nativewind.d.ts`
- The same name as a file or folder in the same directory e.g `app.d.ts` when an `/app` folder exists
- The same name as a folder in `node_modules`, e.g `react.d.ts`

By doing so, your types will not be picked up by the TypeScript compiler.
